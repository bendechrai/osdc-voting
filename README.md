The code isn't designed to be beautiful or performant. Its purpose is to be secure, accurate and rapidly developed. Sample data for the members json has been provided to get you going, of you want to use this yourself.

Pull requests appreciated, as are github issues. Of special interest is any feedback on security or accuracey issues I've missed.
